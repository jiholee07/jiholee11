> MassDM v3, a bot to send DMs to every member of a role in Discord server.


***Use this tool at your own risk!*** 

You will need one thing installed to make this bot work. If you're on Windows, simply run `install_dep.bat`. It can get the prerequisite program for you, and get the libraries needed for this bot to run!
*To get these libraries after installing node.js on an OS other than windows (if you are installing manually), simply open up a terminal in the bot folder and type "npm install -d" without the quotes.*

- Node.JS(LTS version). https://nodejs.org/en/


**Open `config.json` in your code editor and edit the token with your bot token or your user token.** [or remove the "REM" and replate "YOUR TOKEN" in start.bat]

You also need to add in your whitelisted ID (id field in `config.json`); Place the ID of the user who will control the bot.
Once you have that done, save the file.


  Once you have completed all of the above, you may run `start.bat`.

*If you are not running Windows, you need to open a terminal in the bot folder and type "node app.js" without quotes.*



Ideas for development:
- [x] env var token
- [ ] customize bot status
